# IPFS-video-streaming
Website to showcase video streaming over the InterPlanetary File System.

For Exile Jam 2018 i tested out streaming video over IPFS. My main interest was whether it was possible to create a video on demand platform on IPFS that would perform well.

I was happy to see that it was indeed possible. Above is the website I designed to test it out, which you are welcome to try [using a gateway](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipns/XXX) or [directly over IPFS](/ipns/XXX) if you're on the network.

## Advantages

One of my motivations behind using IPFS is the low amount of ressources needed to host content that can be served to an unlimited number of people. Since every IPFS client hosts the content they access, the site's capacity will exponentially increase with every current visitor.
